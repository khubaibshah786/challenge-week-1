## The Repository

This Respository (`'horiseonSeoSite'`) is where a customer have access to Social Solution Services by Horiseon for Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Online Reputation Managment and social media marketing as a service, the Source code is avaliable to everyone under the standard [MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).

The purpose of refactoring this project was to make the website more Accessability friendly so the site is optimized for search engines.

As part of the refactoring process the code was not wrote in a concise and easy to understand format. The code required to be formatted and compressed to allow for compact code and to be understood easily. The navigation link for `'Search Engine Optimisation'` was not working as it had no ID attached to it. also there was no semantics added to the code as this allow individuals who make use of screen readers the ability to read the text.

There was no alt tags on any of the images, again these have been added for the purpose of screen readers.

The CSS was also changed as there were alot of classes with the same properties, these were changed to combine all those which have the same properties, reducing the lines of code and making it more concise.

Comments were also added to the Css where the combination of classes has been updated and generic comments for all the other classes to understand what they have also been added.
